/**
 * sessionRefreshScheduler.ts
 *
 * The access token is short-lived (1h by default — see backend
 * JWT_EXPIRES_IN). Until now, refreshing it only ever happened reactively:
 * a request would fail with 401, and lib/api.ts's response interceptor
 * would refresh and retry. That's fine for a quick click, but it means
 * someone who's been quietly filling out a long form (e.g. "Post a
 * listing", with photos) for the better part of an hour hits their FIRST
 * 401 exactly when they finally click Submit — the worst possible moment
 * for a refresh to fail.
 *
 * This module schedules a silent refresh a few minutes BEFORE the current
 * access token actually expires, while the user is still active, so the
 * reactive 401 path is rarely needed at all during normal use. It's purely
 * an optimization — if a scheduled refresh is missed or fails (tab was
 * asleep, brief network blip), the reactive refresh-on-401 flow in
 * lib/api.ts still catches it on the next real request, so nothing here is
 * relied on for actually keeping the session valid.
