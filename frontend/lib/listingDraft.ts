/**
 * listingDraft.ts
 *
 * Autosaves the "Post a listing" form to localStorage as the seller fills
 * it out. This is the actual safety net for "don't lose a half-finished
 * listing" — it covers every way that could happen (a forced sign-out, an
 * accidental tab close, a browser crash, a flaky connection mid-submit),
 * not just the auth-related causes that the session-expiry work
 * (lib/sessionExpiry.ts, lib/sessionRefreshScheduler.ts) specifically
 * targets. Those two layers are complementary: the auth changes make a
 * session interruption far less likely to happen at all mid-form, and this
 * autosave means that even if one still slips through — or the tab just
 * gets closed by accident — the seller doesn't have to start over.
 *
 * Deliberately create-mode only. Editing an existing listing is never
 * autosaved into this bucket: nothing is written to that listing until Save
 * is explicitly clicked, so an interrupted edit session has nothing at risk
 * to begin with, and mixing edit-in-progress state into a generic "draft"
 * could cause confusing cross-listing overwrites.
