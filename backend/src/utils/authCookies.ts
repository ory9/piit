 * Cookie flags are derived from the ACTUAL request's protocol, not from
 * NODE_ENV. NODE_ENV is easy to leave unset (or "development") on PaaS
 * hosts — Railway in particular does not set it automatically for Node
 * services — and this project's own .env.example ships NODE_ENV=development
 * as the default. Gating on it previously meant that, unless an operator
 * remembered to override it, the refresh cookie was issued as
 * `secure:false; sameSite:'lax'` even in a live deployment — which is a
 * problem here because the frontend (piitrade.com) and backend
 * (*.onrender.com / *.up.railway.app) are on different domains. Browsers
 * never attach a SameSite=Lax cookie to a cross-site fetch/XHR, so every
 * refresh call was silently rejected as soon as the 1h access token
 * expired, which looked like the site randomly logging people out and
 * bouncing them to the login page.
 *
 * `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` (see app.ts) makes `req.secure` reflect the
 * original client protocol via X-Forwarded-Proto, so this is reliable
 * behind Railway/Render/nginx too — and self-corrects regardless of how
 * NODE_ENV happens to be configured on the host.
