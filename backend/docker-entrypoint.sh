# Every hotfix below is intentionally non-fatal on failure (echo + continue,
# never `exit 1`) so that a single bad or inapplicable compatibility SQL
# file — e.g. one referencing a table that doesn't exist yet on a given
# environment, or a transient DB blip — can never prevent this container
# from reaching `exec node dist/index.js` at the bottom. Railway restarts a
# container that never starts listening, and a genuinely broken health
# check looks identical to a CORS failure from the browser's side (no
# process bound to the port = no response headers at all, CORS included).
# A degraded feature from one skipped hotfix is far preferable to the whole
# API being unreachable. `set -e` above only auto-aborts on *unguarded*
# command failures — every `npx prisma db execute` call here is wrapped in
# `if ! ...; then ...; fi`, so set -e never triggers on these regardless.
